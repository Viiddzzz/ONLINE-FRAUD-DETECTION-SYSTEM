# ONLINE-FRAUD-DETECTION-SYSTEM
An intelligent **Machine Learning-based Online Fraud Detection System** designed to identify fraudulent financial transactions in real time.   This project leverages multiple ML models and performance evaluation metrics to ensure high accuracy and reliability in detecting anomalies or suspicious activities.

**📘 Project Overview**

Online fraud in digital transactions is a growing concern in today’s cashless economy.  
This project aims to **predict fraudulent transactions** using machine learning algorithms that analyze transaction patterns and user behavior.

The system uses a labeled dataset of transaction records and applies classification models such as **Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, KNN,** and **SVM**.  
Among these, the **Random Forest Classifier** demonstrated the highest **accuracy and F1-score**, making it the most robust and effective model for fraud detection.



## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect fraudulent transactions automatically based on input features.  
- Compare multiple ML models to identify the most effective one.  
- Visualize fraud patterns and model performance for easy interpretation.  
- Build a foundation for future fraud analytics and prevention systems.



## 🧩 Features

- 🧮 Data preprocessing and encoding of transaction types  
- 📈 Interactive data visualization using **Plotly** and **Seaborn**  
- 🧠 Model training and accuracy comparison among 5 algorithms  
- 📊 Graphical representation of model performance  
- 💾 Export of results to a CSV file for record and analysis  
- 🌐 Browser-based visualization (Plotly charts open in your default browser)



## ⚙️ Machine Learning Models Implemented

| Algorithm | Description | Key Strength |
|------------|--------------|---------------|
| Logistic Regression | Simple and interpretable model | Good baseline for binary classification |
| Decision Tree | Tree-based classifier | Handles non-linear relationships well |
| Random Forest | Ensemble of Decision Trees | Highest accuracy and robustness |
| K-Nearest Neighbors | Distance-based classifier | Works well with balanced datasets |
| Support Vector Machine | Margin-based classifier | Effective for small, well-separated data |

## 🧾 Dataset Information

The dataset contains synthetic transaction records with the following key features:
- `type`: Transaction type (Cash-In, Cash-Out, Payment, Transfer, Debit)  
- `amount`: Transaction amount  
- `oldbalanceOrg`: Sender’s balance before transaction  
- `newbalanceOrig`: Sender’s balance after transaction  
- `isFraud`: Target label indicating whether the transaction is fraudulent (1) or genuine (0)
